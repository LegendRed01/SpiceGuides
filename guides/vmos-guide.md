**&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; VMOS has a high chance for a Red Warning with a Strike &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;**

* You must use a new account or an alternative account to spoof with VMOS then trade the Pokemon to your main account. This is the only way to keep your main account safe and ban-free. You can also play Russian Roulette with your main account but do not come crying to me about it in your Direct or Chat Messages.
* Niantic is unpredictable with their punishment.
* 1st banwave happened on Nov 15, 2019.
* 2nd banwave did not happen yet.
* Read this :[ Cooldown, Strikes, Ban, Safety](../links-faqs-error/cooldown-strikes-ban-safety.md)

​

**Introduction to VMOS spoofing:**

* This guide is for the VMOS app version 2020011609370547986
* You need a Phone or Tablet with 3 GB ram and 32 GB internal storage or more is recommended.
  * You need at least 4 GB of free storage space to use VMOS app.
* If you have a Samsung Galaxy Note series phone or tablet that supports the S Pen stylus, you can use the S Pen to play the game in VMOS.
* If VMOS does not work on your device, you can email: [support@vmos.com](mailto:support@vmos.com)

**VMOS known problems with spoofing:**

* Bluetooth does not work, so you cannot use a Gotcha.
* Camera access does not work, so you cannot use AR mode for your buddy.

​

**1. What you need to download onto your Android smartphone/tablet:**

* \*\*\*\*[**VMOS**](https://oscdn.vmos.com//vmmaster/vmVersion/2019123007514345472.apk%20) \(319 MB\) **version** 2020011609370547986 **from VMOS website:** This is a direct download link. You press on it then a popup appears asking you to save it.

* Prevent Screenshot = Disabled
* **Display Distance Info = Up to you to Enable or Disable**
  * This is to help you calculate the distance and time you need to wait between your current location to your new location. This is useful if you are sniping Pokemon or doing Research Tasks with a PokeMap. You should also keep of your cooldown on a paper or in a note app. If you want to be extra careful, you can disable it then wait 2 hours or more between teleports.
* Enable Suspended Mocking = Disabled
* Enable Auto Suspend Location = Disabled
* Auto Suspend Interval = 30 s \(default\)
* Enable Indirect Mocking = Disabled
* **Enable System Mode = Enabled** by default
  * If this is Disabled, it means you did not not systemize it with Lucky Patcher and it will also ask you to put the app in Mock Locations. DO NOT PUT IT in Mock Locations. You need to start over with step 1.
* Enable A-GPS Reset = Disabled
* Select Background Thread = Android Handler by default
* Save Last Location = Disabled
* Auto Close App = Disabled
* Auto Start JoyStick = Disabled
* Auto Start App = None
* **Joystick Type: up to you to change**
  * Drawer
    * Buttons are bigger and easier to press.
    * To autowalk, press the lock button then drag the joystick to the direct you want to autowalk.
    * To stop autowalking, you press on the lock button to stop it.
  * Classic
    * To autowalk, press down in the middle of the joystick to "lock it" then drag the joystick in the direction you want to autowalk in.
    * To stop the autowalking, press in the middle of the joystick to "unlock it" or drag the locked joystick back to the center \(can be a little hard\).
    * Easier to pause and play your GPX route.
* **Joystick Size = up to you to change**
* **Joystick** **Opacity = up to you to change**
* **Walking Speed: 4 to 6 km/h**
  * If you use a GPX Route, these speeds will allow you to "shiny check" \(check if the Pokemon is shiny then flee if it is not shiny\) at a slower walking speed. This should give you enough time to check all the Pokemon at the Lured Pokestop before moving onto the next Pokestop.
  * Mainly areas with lures in a small area like Budapest and small parks.
* **Jogging Speed: 9 km/h**
  * For hatching eggs.
  * Some people will argue like 10.5 is the maximum, you can be the judge of that. I think 9 km/h is the best.
  * Mainly for areas where the Pokestops are far apart like in big parks or city routes.
* **Running Speed: 30 km/h**
  * Mainly for using the joystick to move around.
  * If you go above 30, you will get the "you are moving too fast" pop-up.
  * Not recommend to be used with GPX Routes.
* Advance Settings = leave them by default \(do not change anything\)

​

**For "Fake GPS Joystick & Routes Go by Incorporate Apps" users of this spoofing app.**

* This is an alternative to GPS Joystick that costs $4 USD to use with a permanent ad-free experience with unlimited installs. I decided to move this down here, since so many people were trying to find this in VMOS without knowing this is an alternative spoofing app.
* You find this paid app inside the Google Play Store inside VMOS. You have to pay for it before you can use it.
* You must do Part 8 for this spoofing app in order to get "Expert Mode = enabled". If it is not systemized, this box will be greyed out and you cannot turn it on.
* Go to 3 dots &gt; App Settings:
  * **Expert Mode = enabled!**
  * **Disabled Fused Location Services = must be unchecked \(no check\) !**
  * **Mock Location in Developer Options = none!**
  * No-Root Mode = greyed out
  * Enable Joystick = tap to enable
  * Joystick Size = your choice
  * Joystick Transparency = your choice
  * Update interval = 500
  * GPS accuracy = 1
  * Move around fake location = must be disabled or you risk a Red Warning/strike
  * GPS Speed = 9.0 is the max I used

**Problem fixes:**

**FIX \#1 - Unable to log in or unable to authenticate**

* Another user suggested this, but it may not work for everyone.
* Close VMOS and clear your recent apps first before doing this.
* Go into your device's settings to &gt; Apps / Apps Manager &gt; press on VMOS &gt; press on storage &gt; clear cache
* If it does not work, VMOS app is not supported on your device. There is nothing I can do to help you.

**FIX \#2 - Location Errors or Rubberbanding \(teleporting back and forth\) inside the game**

* **Inside VMOS app**
  * Press the "white diamond grey button" \(bottom right corner\) to open Setting &gt; press on System Setting &gt; press on Location &gt; press on "Device only"
  * Remove your spoofing app out of Mock Locations in Developer's Option. This guide does not tell you to put it there.
* **Outside VMOS in your phone/tablet's settings**
  * Swipe down from the top of your screen to press on the little gear icon to open Settings &gt; Find "Location" or Press and hold on the Location/GPS icon \(different on each device\)
  * Some smartphones or tablets have some of these available but not all of them. Find what you have and change them.
    * **Location Mode with 3 options: High Accuracy, Battery Saving, or Device only** = Set it to "Device only".
    * **Emergency Location Service** = on or off is fine, it does not matter for spoofing.
    * **Google Location History** = Select your VMOS spoofing account &gt; Disable it &gt; it will say "Location History \(paused\)"
    * **Improve Accuracy for Wi-Fi scanning and Bluetooth scanning** = off for both of them
    * **Google Location Accuracy** = off
  * When you need to use Google Maps/Waze or whatever navigation app for driving directions, you must turn Google Location Accuracy on or Location Mode to High Accuracy so your app can see your current location. When you are finished driving around and want to go back to spoofing, you change these settings to back how they were.

**FIX \#3 - How to back up or restore GPS Joystick favorite coords and GPX Routes**

**Backup your coords and routes:**

> If you uninstall your VMOS app to start all over, your backup file will be deleted. You must go find the .db file to save to your main device's internal storage.

1. Open GPS Joystick, go to settings
2. Press Save Database
3. Press Downloads
4. Press SAVE
5. Press OK
6. Press White Square to clear all windows

**Restore your GPS Joystick backup:**

1. Open GPS Joystick, go to settings
2. Press Restore Database
3. Press on "gpsjoystick\_XXXXXX.db"
4. Press Restart
5. Press White Square to clear all windows
6. Open GPS Joystick again then all your favorites coords and routes should be there again.

**Frequently Asked Questions about VMOS**

**FAQ\#1 - How do I use Gotcha / Go Plus / Pokeball Plus / other device with VMOS?**

* VMOS does not support bluetooth, so you cannot pair a Gotcha with VMOS.

**FAQ\#2 - Pokemon Go asking for an update**

* Download the newest version of Pokemon Go **armeabi-v7a** type from Part 1 then import it again in Part 5. I will change the link when there is a new version, since so many people do not know there are two different version of the game to download. Many people still download the wrong one and message me about the game failing to import/install.

**FAQ\#3 - Should I update VMOS?**

* Yes

**FAQ\#4 - Is there anyway to make VMOS "safer"?**

* No because you are using an emulator to spoof. It does not matter what tweaks \(ex. renaming GPS Joystick in privacy mode\) you do, you will get a Red Warning when the next wave comes. This is why you need to use a new account to spoof with VMOS.

**FAQ\#5 - Can I use this VMOS guide for other games like WU, Minecraft, and etc?**

* For WU and Ingress, No because the VFIN app was designed for Pokemon Go only.
* For GPS games that are Niantic related, maybe without the VFIN app. This guide is for Pokemon Go only. All off-game question comments will be removed.

**FAQ\#6 - Does this guide work on Bluestacks or Nox?**

* [j3txky22](https://www.reddit.com/user/j3txky22/) has confirmed it does not work on Bluestacks and Nox. See comment the by clicking or pressing [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGoSpoofing/comments/dzky37/no_root_android_using_vmos_emulator_app_to_spoof/f8atvi8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**FAQ\#7 - Can I spoof on my main account with VMOS?**

* DO NOT USE YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT!!!!!!!! IF YOU USE YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT, YOU WILL 100% CRY TO ME ABOUT IT LATER AND I WILL IGNORE YOUR MESSAGE.
* A lot of people who do not understand English will ask me this question in a private message.

**FAQ\#8 - If I use VMOS on a rooted phone and add it into Magisk Hide, will it be safe for me to use my main account?**

* The answer is still a NO and refer to FAQ\#4. I used VMOS on a rooted phone with a test/throwaway account, and it got a Red Warning.

**FAQ\#9 - Are my other accounts safe outside of VMOS?**

* Yes as long as you do not log into Pokemon Go using VMOS with your other accounts. My rooted phone has multiple accounts and only 1 of 5 accounts has a Red Warning. The other 4 accounts are Red Warning-free because I never added them to VMOS. These are also test/throwaway accounts too.
