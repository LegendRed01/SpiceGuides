### Can I root my Phone and is it safe?

If you can root depends on your Phone search for your model number on [TWRPs Website](https://twrp.me/Devices/), if you can't find your Phones model number you can't root.

Rooting in general is a safe process but on almost all phones you  lose your warranty if you do root.  
Before you root your phone find a written guide and follow that and _**always make a backup of your phone and download the stock firmware of your device for safety!**_

## **0. Install Magisk Root and Magisk Manager**

After you installed TWRP download the newest Version of [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases) and the Manager.  
Copy both files to your Phone and reboot into Recovery Mode \(TWRP\).  
Click on the Install button and flash the Magisk.zip file you downloaded from above.  
Reboot the device, first reboot after Magisk has been flashed can take a couple of minutes so be patient.
