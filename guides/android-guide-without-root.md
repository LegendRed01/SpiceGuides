* [Google Play Service](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-play-services/google-play-services-12-6-85-release/) APK for your device
* Read this :[ Cooldown, Strikes, Ban, Safety](../links-faqs-error/cooldown-strikes-ban-safety.md)

#### One of those Spoofing Apps :

* [GPS Joystick by Appninja](http://gpsjoystick.theappninjas.com/faq/)
* [FGL Pro](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18oZ1ECJe4F_w8J3EkeaR3v9FMPnLv_Q-/view)

## Downgrading Google Play Services

* _**IF your current version is below 12.6.85 Update to the latest version and then continue!\#**_

1. Before Downgrading Google Services, write down what version you have installed first. \(this info will be helpful when looking for your version\)  
   `Settings < Apps < Google Play Services <`   
   An example, mine is 17.1.22\(040300-XXXXXXXXX\)

   The numbers after the **`-`** do not matter

2. Disable background data usage for Service
3. Uninstall Google Play Services Updates
4. Disable the storage permission for services
5. Clear Data & Cache of Google Play Services in App Storage
