[Samsung Store Pokemon Go APK](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/niantic-inc/pokemon-go-samsung-galaxy-apps-version/)

This is an official unmodified pogo app that is from Samsung's Galaxy App Store. This will allow you to use two pogo apps onto your device: New account for PGSharp app and main account for pogo app from \(Galaxy App store\). This APK link will work on non-Samsung devices as long as your device can use the new arm64-v8a type.
