## Can I get banned for Spoofing

* **Short answer is yes.**
  * GPS spoofing breaches Terms of Service, so it means you are a cheater, I am a cheater, and we are all cheaters!
* **Long answer is not right away** but depends on your situation.
  * If you _have_ _**received one or multiple Red Warnings before they implemented the 3 strikes system**_, the next time you receive a Red Warning, it could be either your 2nd strike \(30 day temporary ban\) or 3rd strike \(account termination/permanently banned\). I am not Niantic and cannot tell you if your account is clean or you have had over 30 Red Warnings since 2017. You can contact Niantic's Customer Service team.
  * If you _have_ _**never received a Red Warning or just started spoofing**_, they do not terminate/ban your account right away. You are put on the "3 strikes" system. My advice is to avoid the 1st strike/Red Warning at all cost. Once your account has the 1st strike, you either be very careful or go legit forever on that account. If they detect anything suspicious, you may be given a 2nd or even a 3rd strike. I have read posts where people claim they were extra careful and still got their 2nd and 3rd strike one after the other.
* Keep in mind, they can change their policy at any given time.
  * If you plan to live stream your spoofing and Niantic figures out who you are or you accidentally showed your trainer name, they can instantly terminate the account.

## Is it safe to buy accounts?

* The answer is no because of these reasons:
  * The seller can scam you by recovering the account and email address X amount days later. The are ways to do it even if they give out the email address and password. Throwaway email addresses can be recovered.
  * The seller could have sold you an account that had just received a strike but did not tell you about it. One softban can trigger the 2nd or 3rd strike.
  * It is impossible to get a refund once you buy digital items like accounts, Pokemon, and services.
* If you still want to buy an account or a service you have been warned



## **How do I avoid getting a Red Warning with a Strike?**

* Follow the cooldown chart or just wait 2 hours \(plus a few minutes more\).
  * **My tip** is you should write down on a piece of paper when you stop playing the game. For example, if I stop at 4:00 PM, I write down 4:00 PM. Later when it is 6:00 PM \(or at 6:03 PM to be extra safe; waiting a few more minutes is not going to harm you\), I can teleport or snipe. Let say I forgot to write it down or thought I could remember it, I write down the current time \(1:34 PM\) then I wait +2 hours more. When it becomes after 3:37 PM \(with an extra 3 minutes\), I can snipe or teleport.
  * **Simple answer:** If you don't know, you should just wait 2 hours and 3 minutes.
  * **If the math is too hard**, wait the next day when you wake up from sleeping.

## **Which spoofing method is the least risk to the most risk?**

1. **Play Legit**
2. Rooted Android device \(Smali Patcher or Systemized method; not using VMOS\)
3. iTools Mobile
4. No Root Android by downgrading Google Play Services
5. iSpoofer,iPogo 
6.  3rd party iOS app stores + cracked iSpoofer + iSpoofer alternatives
7. iSpoofer or iTools on a computer, VMOS, DeFit or any type of fake step count

## **Can I spoof on my main account?**

You are basically gambling every time you spoof on your main account. You must be willing to accept if you use any spoofing app, you have a chance at getting a strike anywhere from 1% to 100% depending on which way you decide to go. If you follow the cooldown and keep track of it on paper or in a note app, you should be good to spoof on your main account.
